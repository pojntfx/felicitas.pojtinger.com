Welcome to Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services. We welcome you ("you" or the "user") as a user and we encourage you to join our community. Before you participate, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Service ("Terms of Service").

### 2. What We Provide

Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services provide various documents and services associated with Free and Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects.

### 3. Allowed Content & Usage

(1) By using Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services, you agree to adhere to the following rules when providing data:

1. Our service is only available to users from the EU/EEA, with a minimum age requirement of 16.
2. The data you provide through the forms of our website and services may not contain harmful code or should use proper disclaimers and protections if used in an acceptable context (e.g. for security research).
3. You must not share any content that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group for any reason. We also _explicitly_ do not tolerate:
   - Discriminatory behavior towards and promoting oppression, especially of marginalized groups on grounds of ethnicity, gender, disability, nationality, education, age, and religion.
   - Violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.
   - Mobbing, stalking, doxxing (exposing someone's personal information), brigading (inciting a group to spam a specific place for any reason), threatening and harassment, as well as encouraging others to do those things.
   - Insults, discriminatory jokes, sexualized comments and other unwanted sexual attention.
   - Sexually obscene content, including content involving the exploitation or sexualization of minors.
   - Content that glorifies violence; that includes any violent material without a proper content warning.
   - Content that harms the reputation of Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services.

(2) Failure to comply with the rules in Art. 3 (1) leads to immediate removal of the content together with a warning; further violations might result in immediate account suspension. In non-obvious cases, decisions about account suspensions and content removal are made by the presidium, and require a simple majority.

(3) We additionally reserve the right to remove any content or account with a notice providing a reason and possibly conditions for re-uploading the content.

(4) Content that is deemed illegal in Germany (e.g. by violating copyright or privacy laws) will be taken offline and may lead to immediate account suspension.

(5) Actions intended to damage Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services, its reputation, service availability or performance may lead to immediate account suspension. In the case of excessive traffic/resource usage, or unreasonable storage requirements, a warning will normally be issued at first, unless the actions are obviously done with malicious intent.

### 4. Rights, Responsibilities, Copyright & Guarantees

(1) Please see our [privacy policy](../privacy/dynamic.md) to learn more about your rights as a subject of personal data processing.

(2) You are responsible for your own actions. Please act accordingly and apply appropriate security measures to protect your own data and account access credentials. This means especially that:

- You are legally responsible for your edits and contributions on the platform, so for your own protection you should exercise caution and avoid contributing any content that may result in criminal or civil liability under any applicable laws (e.g. copyright and patent infringements, but also things like age-restricted content without age confirmation). Both the German legislation and the legislation in your country of residence may be relevant here.
- You are solely responsible for your use of any third-party websites or resources. Although some projects may contain links to third-party websites and resources, we do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, or the related content, products, or services, nor do we have any obligation to monitor such third-party content.
- You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and should never disclose them to any third party.
- You must make sure that we have a way to contact you by keeping the email address of your account up-to-date.

(3) All content provided to Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services is uploaded by community members. Contributors own all rights and ownership for content and contributions they provided. Using the platform does not imply any transfer of ownership or copyright.

(4) We make no guarantees about the availability of the content hosted on our platform. Although we try to preserve all content for the future, you are solely responsible for making regular backups of everything you rely on.

(5) Changes to the Terms of Service are communicated by invalidating sessions and prompting you to accept the current Terms of Service. If you disagree with a change, you are responsible for closing your account.

### 5. Cancellation and Termination

(1) You may close your account at any time. Please be aware that it is your responsibility to remove content and contributions that you no longer wish to persist. All other content previously contributed by you might remain visible to other users of the platform.

(2) Abandoned user accounts with no (or next to no) usage may be deleted after being unused for 365 days. A warning via email is sent 1 month in advance.

(3) Accounts created for the sole purpose of advertisement (excessive promotion of a product, service or company) are removed immediately.

(4) Please be aware that this list is neither exhaustive nor complete (illustrating the spirit of the law, not its letter). Be aware that any account can get suspended at any time if it is used for activities harming Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services or its associated platform and services, directly or indirectly, even if these activities are not explicitly listed in the examples above.

### 6. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability

(1) The materials on our platform are provided on an 'as is' basis. Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services make no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

(2) Further, Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on their website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

(3) In no event shall Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services or their suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services, even if Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services or a Felicitas Pojtinger's website and services-authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
